    "A workflow controls the setup and the execution of individual interfaces. Let's assume you want to run multiple interfaces in a specific order, where some have to wait for others to finish while others can be executed in parallel. The nice thing about a nipype workflow is, that the workflow  will take care of input and output of each interface and arrange the execution of each interface in the most efficient way.\n",

    "A workflow therefore consists of multiple [Nodes](basic_nodes.ipynb), each representing a specific [Interface](basic_interfaces.ipynb) and directed connection between those nodes. Those connections specify which output of which node should be used as an input for another node. To better understand why this is so great, let's look at an example."
