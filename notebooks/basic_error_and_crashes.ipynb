    "Probably the most important chapter in this section is about how to handle error and crashes. Because at the beginning you will run into a few.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. You specified filenames or paths that **don't exist**.\n",
    "2. You try to give an interface a ``string`` as input, where a ``float`` value is expected or you try to specify a parameter that doesn't exist. Be sure to use the right **``input type``** and input name.\n",
    "3. You wanted to give a list of inputs ``[func1.nii, func2.nii, func3.nii]`` to a node that only expects one input file. **``MapNode``** is your solution.\n",
    "4. You wanted to run SPM's motion correction on compressed NIfTI files, i.e. ``*.nii.gz``? **SPM** cannot handle that. Nipype's **``Gunzip``** interface can help.\n",
    "5. You haven't set up all necessary **environment variables**. Nipype, for example, doesn't find your MATLAB or SPM version.\n",
    "6. You **forget** to specify a **mandatory input** field.\n",
    "7. You try to **connect** a node to an input field that another node is **already connected** to.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important** note about ``crashfiles``. ``Crashfiles`` are only created when you run a workflow, not during building a workflow. If you have a typo in a folder path, because they didn't happen during runtime, but still during workflow building.\n",
