    "We've learned from the [Workflow](./basic_workflow.ipynb) tutorial that every Nipype workflow is a directed acyclic graph. Some workflow structures are easy to understand directly from the script and some others are too complex for that. Luckily, there is the ``write_graph`` method!\n",

    "## ``write_graph``\n",
    "\n",
    "**``write_graph``** allows us to visualize any workflow in five different ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **``orig``** - creates a top-level graph without expanding internal workflow nodes\n",
    "- **``flat``** - expands workflow nodes recursively\n",
    "- **``hierarchical``** - expands workflow nodes recursively with a notion on the hierarchy\n",
    "- **``colored``** - expands workflow nodes recursively with a notion on hierarchy in color\n",
    "- **``exec``** - expands workflows to depict iterables\n",
    "\n",
    "Which graph visualization should be used is chosen by the **``graph2use``** parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, we can also choose the format of the output file (png or svg) with the **``format``** parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "A third parameter, called **``simple_form``** can be used to specify if the node names used in the graph should be of the form ***``nodename (package)``*** or  ***``nodename.Class.package``***."
