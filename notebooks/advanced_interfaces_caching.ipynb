    "\n",
    "One good rule of thumb to respect is to avoid the usage of explicit filenames apart from the outermost inputs and outputs of your processing. The reason being that the caching mechanism of `nipy.caching` takes care of generating the unique hashes, ensuring that, when you vary parameters, files are not overridden by the output of different computations.\n",

    "<div class=\"alert alert-info\">\n",
    "**Debugging**:  \n",
    "If you need to inspect the running environment of the nodes, it may be useful to know where they were executed. With `nipype.caching`, you do not control this location as it is encoded by hashes.  \n",
    "To find out where an operation has been persisted, simply look in it's output variable:  \n",
    "```out.runtime.cwd```\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the more you explore different parameters, the more you risk creating cached results that will never be reused. Keep in mind that it may be useful to flush the cache using [`Memory.clear_previous_runs`](http://nipype.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/generated/nipype.caching.memory.html#nipype.caching.memory.Memory.clear_previous_runs) or [`Memory.clear_runs_since`](http://nipype.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/generated/nipype.caching.memory.html#nipype.caching.memory.Memory.clear_runs_since)."
