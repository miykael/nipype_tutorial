    "# What is Nipype?\n",
    "\n",
    "[Nipype](http://nipype.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) (Neuroimaging in Python - Pipelines and Interfaces) is an open-source, user-friendly, community-developed software package under the umbrella of [NiPy](http://nipy.org/). Nipype allows you to pipeline your neuroimaging workflow in an intuitive way and enables you to use the software packages and algorithms you want to use, regardless their programing language. This is possible because Nipype provides an uniform interface to many existing neuroimaging processing and analysis packages like [ANTS](http://stnava.github.io/ANTs/), [SPM](http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/), [FSL](http://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/), [FreeSurfer](http://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/), [Camino](http://web4.cs.ucl.ac.uk/research/medic/camino/pmwiki/pmwiki.php), [MRtrix](http://www.brain.org.au/software/mrtrix/index.html), [MNE](https://martinos.org/mne/stable/index.html), [AFNI](https://afni.nimh.nih.gov/afni), [Slicer](https://www.slicer.org/) and many more. Nipype allows you to easily combine all those heterogeneous software packages within a single workflow. This procedure gives you the opportunity to pick the best algorithm there is for the problem at hand and therefore allows you to profit from the advantages of any software package you like.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nipype is written in [Python](https://www.python.org/), an easy to learn and very intuitive programming language. This ensures a rather steep learning curve and makes you a Nipype expert in no time. Nipype provides an environment that encourages interactive exploration of algorithms. It allows you to make your research easily reproducible and lets you share your code with the community. And for any problem you can encounter, there's always a community standing behind you."

    "Let's assume you want to do preprocessing that uses **SPM** for *motion correction*, **FreeSurfer** for *coregistration*, **ANTS** for *normalization* and **FSL** for *smoothing*. Normally this would be a hell of a mess. Switching between multiple scripts in different programming languages with a lot of manual intervention. On top of all that, you want to do your analysis on multiple subjects, preferably as fast as possible, i.e., processing several subjects in parallel. With Nipype, this is no problem! You can do all this and much more.\n",
