    "With its [DAGMan](http://research.cs.wisc.edu/htcondor/dagman/dagman.html) component, [HTCondor](http://www.cs.wisc.edu/htcondor/) (previously Condor) allows for submitting the entire graphs of dependent jobs at once (similar to SGEGraph and SLURMGraph). With the ``CondorDAGMan`` plug-in, Nipype can utilize this functionality to submit complete workflows directly and in a single step.  Consequently, and in contrast to other plug-ins, workflow execution returns almost instantaneously -- Nipype is only used to generate the workflow graph, while job scheduling and dependency resolution are entirely managed by [HTCondor](http://www.cs.wisc.edu/htcondor/).\n",
    "\n",
    "Please note that although [DAGMan](http://research.cs.wisc.edu/htcondor/dagman/dagman.html) supports specification of data dependencies as well as data provisioning on compute nodes this functionality is currently not supported by this plug-in. As with all other batch systems supported by Nipype, only HTCondor pools with a shared file system can be used to process Nipype workflows.\n",

    "- `submit_template` : submit spec template for individual jobs in a DAG (see CondorDAGManPlugin.default_submit_template for the default.\n",
    "- `initial_specs` : additional submit specs that are prepended to any job's submit file\n",
    "- `override_specs` : additional submit specs that are appended to any job's submit file\n",
    "- `wrapper_cmd` : path to an executable that will be started instead of a node script. This is useful for wrapper script that executes certain functionality prior to or after a node runs. If this option is given the wrapper command is called with the respective Python executable and the path to the node script as final arguments\n",
    "- `wrapper_args` : optional additional arguments to a wrapper command\n",
    "- `dagman_args` : arguments to be prepended to the job execution script in the dagman call\n",
    "- `block` : if True the plugin call will block until Condor has finished processing the entire workflow (default: False)\n",
    "\n",
    "Please see the [HTCondor documentation](http://research.cs.wisc.edu/htcondor/manual) for details on possible configuration options and command line arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the ``wrapper_cmd`` argument it is possible to combine Nipype workflow execution with checkpoint/migration functionality offered by, for example, [DMTCP](http://dmtcp.sourceforge.net/). This is especially useful in the case of workflows with long-running nodes, such as Freesurfer's recon-all pipeline, where Condor's job prioritization algorithm could lead to jobs being evicted from compute nodes in order to maximize overall throughput. With checkpoint/migration enabled such a job would be checkpointed prior eviction and resume work from the checkpointed state after being rescheduled -- instead of restarting from scratch.\n",
