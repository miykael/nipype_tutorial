    "As you learned in the [Workflow](basic_workflow.ipynb) tutorial, a workflow is executed with the ``run`` method. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "    workflow.run()\n",
    "\n",
    "Whenever you execute a workflow like this, it will be executed in serial order. This means that no node will be executed in parallel, even if they are completely independent of each other. Now, while this might be preferable under certain circumstances, we usually want to executed workflows in parallel. For this, Nipype provides many different plugins."
