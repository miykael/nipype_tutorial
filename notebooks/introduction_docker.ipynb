    "[Docker](https://www.docker.com) is an open-source project that automates the deployment of applications inside software containers. Those containers wrap up a piece of software in a complete filesystem that contains everything it needs to run: code, system tools, software libraries, such as Python, FSL, AFNI, SPM, FreeSurfer, ANTs, etc. This guarantees that it will always run the same, regardless of the environment it is running in.\n",

    "<font color='red'>Important:</font> **You don't need Docker to run Nipype on your system**. For Mac and Linux users, it probably is much simpler to install Nipype directly on your system. For more information on how to do this see the [Nipype website](http://nipype.readthedocs.io/en/latest/users/install.html). But for Windows user, or users that don't want to setup all the dependencies themselves, Docker is the way to go."
